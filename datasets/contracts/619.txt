//! Fragnova ink! smart contract developers should integrate these method definitions into the environment of their smart contracts (https://paritytech.github.io/ink/ink/attr.chain_extension.html#example-environment),

/// `#[ink::chain_extension]` defines the interface for a chain extension.
///
/// The interface consists of an error code that indicates lightweight errors as well as the definition of some chain extension methods.
/// The overall structure follows that of a simple Rust trait definition. The error code is defined as an associated type definition of the trait definition.
/// The methods are defined as associated trait methods without implementation.
///
/// Chain extension methods must not have a `self` receiver such as `&self` or `&mut self` and
/// must have inputs and output that implement the SCALE encoding and decoding.
/// Their return value follows specific rules that can be altered using the `handle_status` attribute.

	/// Error codes of the chain extension.

	/// # Footnote:
	///
	/// By default (i.e unless the `handle_status` attribute is `false`)
	/// all chain extension methods should return a `Result<T, E>` where `E: From<Self::ErrorCode>`.
	/// The `Self::ErrorCode` represents the error code of the chain extension.
	/// This means that a smart contract calling such a chain extension method first queries
	/// the returned status code of the chain extension method and
	/// **only loads and decodes the output if the returned status code indicates a successful call.**
	///
	/// A chain extension method that is flagged with `handle_status = false` assumes that the returned error code will always indicate success.
	/// Therefore it will always load and decode the output buffer and loses the `E: From<Self::ErrorCode>` constraint for the call.
	///
	/// Note that if a chain extension method does not return `Result<T, E>` where `E: From<Self::ErrorCode>`, but `handle_status = true` it will still
	/// return a value of type `Result<T, Self::ErrorCode>`.
